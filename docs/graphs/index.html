  <h1>6581 Audio Graphs</h1>
  <p>
    This is a collection of graphs of output from the 6581 SID emulation. There are several sets of
    graphs spread across six pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of the graphs covers 25,000 processor cycles, plotting the audio level at each cycle. Some
    points will of course be culled (unless you're viewing on a display that's at least 25,000
    pixels wide), but this is by far the most accurate waveform views that I've been able to
    produce.
  </p>

        <td>
          These are outputs from the waveform generator alone at several settings. Each combination
          of waveforms is available at two frequencies, A4 (440 Hz) and A7 (3520 Hz). No
          combinations of waveforms with noise are shown because those combinations always output
          a steady 0.

        <td><a href="sync.html">Sync and ring modulation</a></td>
        <td>
          Additional waveform generator outputs, but these are produced by synching two generators.
          Three sync graphs are available per waveform (except noise, which isn't going to look
          much different if synched), one at A4 synched to C4 (261.6 Hz), one at A7 synched to C4,
          and one at A7 synched to C7 (2093 Hz). A set of three similar graphs are shown for
          ring-modulated triangle waves (only triangle can be ring-modulated).
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="envelope.html">Envelope generator</a></td>
        <td>
          Outputs directly from the envelope generator. There is a small variety of different
          settings for attack, decay, sustain, and release shown. All of them are very low settings
          as even an attack of 3 will last longer than 25,000 clock cycles. The graph at the bottom
          demonstrates the wrapping bug that happens when an attack is gated and the gate is
          immediately turned off; the level <em>should</em> stay at 0, but it instead wraps around
          to 255 and drops as a normal release.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="voice.html">Voice</a></td>
        <td>
          Outputs from the amplitude modulator that combines the waveform and envelope generator
          outputs. These graphs are all generated from the same envelope settings: attack 0, decay
          0, sustain 8, and release 0.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="filter.html">Filter</a></td>
        <td>
          Outputs directly from the internal filter/mixer. The top three graphs show unmixed,
          unfiltered voices; the rest of the graphs show the same three waveforms combined and
          filtered in various ways. The low, band, and high pass filters are used with three
          different cutoff frequencies.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="chip.html">Full chip test</a></td>
        <td>
          The same graphs as with the filter, but including the external filter. This is also the
          only set of graphs that's produced fully through the regular pin interface without the
          benefit of accessing individual internal parts of the 6581. The output shown is what comes
          off the <code>AUDIO</code> pin.
