    Currently, there are two types of documenation available.

  <table>

        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>

        <td>
          <p>
            There isn't property an API for this project as it's ultimately just an executable. But
            there are quite a lot of details about the individual parts that go into making this
            project.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "contents" for the API is a little unusual since this isn't a library. The API is
            for the file that will contain the <code>main</code> function that starts the
            executable, and all of the parts are in the "Imports" section.

        <td>
          The 6581 Sound Interface Device is tricky to test since the waveforms it produces are so
          complex. While proper unit testing is done on the outputs of the waveform and envelope
          generators, the rest is "tested" by producing graphs of the audio output and figuring out
          if it looks right. Those graphs are all available here.
